# Saber Quest: Echoes of the Fallen
## By Zian Zeng, Feiyi Chen

___________________________________________________________________________________________
_In a vast, desolate desert where time fractures between day and night, you return—haunted, relentless. Once, this place held everything you cherished. Now, it’s overrun by the undead, echoes of a tragedy you refuse to forget. Armed only with your hands and a glowing lightsaber, you grasp and hurl debris, slicing through the horde as time shifts around you—ruins growing older, the world eroding with each cycle._

_The dramatic, sorrowful score follows your every move, whispering of the love you lost, the vengeance that drives you. Is this your redemption, or just a cycle of endless despair? The past won’t stay buried, and neither will they._

_Built-in **Unreal Engine 4** for **Meta Quest 3**, Echoes of the Fallen delivers a raw, immersive combat experience where time and fate are your greatest enemies. Fight. Survive. End it._
